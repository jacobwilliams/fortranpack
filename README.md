To use this, just add this to your project's `fpm.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
fortranpack = { git="https://github.com/jacobwilliams/fortranpack.git" }
```
### Building

By default, the library is built with double precision (`real64`) real values. Explicitly specifying the real kind can be done using the following preprocessor flags:

Preprocessor flag | Kind  | Number of bytes
----------------- | ----- | ---------------
`REAL32`  | `real(kind=real32)`  | 4
`REAL64`  | `real(kind=real64)`  | 8
`REAL128` | `real(kind=real128)` | 16

For example, to build a quad precision version of the library, use:

```
fpm build --profile release --flag "-DREAL128"
```
